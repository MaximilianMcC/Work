# What is Work?
Work is an app that is similar to stuff such as OneNote, Word/Powerpoint, Google docs/google slides, readme,ms's, etc... It's supposed to be a nice way to store information cleanly and efficiently.

# General structure
Each document will be called a "book", which will be a single file. A book can contain as many "pages" as you'd like. These pages are infinite, to a degree. Here is an example of a student:
```yml
Book: Physics
 - Page: Mechanics
 - Page: Electromagnetism
 - Page: Practical Investigation
 - Page: Other

Book: English
 - Page: Speech
 - Page: Profile writing
 - Page: Writing portfolio
 - Page: Language techniques

Book: Digital Art
 - Page: Photoshop
 - Page: Blender
 - Page: Animation
 - Page: UI Design
 - Page: Poster Design
 - Page: Wallpaper
```
